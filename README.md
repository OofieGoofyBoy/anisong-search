# Anisong Search

## WTF

This is an app that provides a quick way to search for an anime given a fragment of the lyrics of one of its songs ~so you can cheat at Anime Music Quiz~.

## Requisites

You might need to run [this crawler](https://github.com/marcoskwkm/anisong-crawler) to generate the song data to be consumed by this app.

## Issues and future improvements

- Search should be made more flexible (it currently checks for exact match).
- Unable to filter by song type (opening/ending/insert)
- Search keywords are not highlighted in the lyrics.
- Crude UI.
